# hackingmadeEZnutz
A compilation of automation scripts I wrote to automate mundane and repetitive tasks. Most of these are going to be either in python3 or bash; Maybe GO if I ever feel fancy.

In case you didn't get the joke, it's a wordplay on "Hackingmadeez" but "deez" reminds me of **DEEZ NUTZ.**
